# hello-world
This is my review of the first git tutorial to create repository and projects. I am Nicolas Betancourt a recent graduate of Texas State University eagerly searching for data analyst positions in the Central Texas area (mainly Austin) to begin my career. I am so excited to finally take on projects and learn to master my analyst skills.
